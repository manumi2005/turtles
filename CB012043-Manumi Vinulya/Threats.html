            <p>During their long lives, sea turtles travel between land and sea and swim thousands of miles in the
                ocean.
                They must wait decades to breed before returning to the same beaches where they were born to lay their
                eggs.
                Females can lay hundreds of eggs in a single nesting season, but only a small percentage of them will
                hatch
                and survive their first year.
                <br><br>Aside from these substantial natural dangers, sea turtles face a variety of human-caused
                problems,
                including by catch in commercial fishing gear, illegal trading, consumption, and climate change.

            <p>Sea a turtles are still being collected in an unsustainable manner, both for human consumption and for
                the
                trading of their parts. Many people around the world rely on turtle meat and eggs for sustenance and
                revenue. Turtles are also killed for medicine and religious ceremonies by some people. Every year, tens
                of
                thousands of sea turtles are killed in this manner, decimating populations of already endangered green

                regulate

                turtle

            <p>Education is critical to addressing marine pollution. The public can become involved in this problem by
                doing
                the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Adhering to local codes enforcing fertilizer bans near waterways</li>
                <li>Using fewer chemical fertilizers and instead opting for natural compost</li>
                <li>Reducing oil consumption by carpooling, taking public transportation, or purchasing energy-efficient
                    vehicles</li>
                <li>Getting informed about local waste disposal to ensure that untreated waste water is not introduced
