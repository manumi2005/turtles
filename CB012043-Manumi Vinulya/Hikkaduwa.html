            <h1>HIKKADUWA TURTLE HATCHERY</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="para_box">
            <p> Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery is located on the beach, roughly 2 km north of Hikkaduwa. A small and
                private research center that aims to protect the endangered marine turtles, the hatchery offers
                a
                selective display of turtle eggs and exhibits the progressive development of turtles. There are
                some
                spots where you can also get an opportunity to release baby turtles into the vast ocean for an
                additional fee. The best time to visit here and see the turtles is March through April.
                <br><br> Presently, there are five species of turtles that are taken care of in the hatchery and
                rescue centre. Such species are the Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle,
                Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle. The facilities of the sea turtle hatchery and rescue centre
                are
                all state-of-the-art, complete with water tanks to care for newborn turtles, along with adult
                turtle
                species that have been rescued from the sea due to injuries. One of the more peculiar sights in
                the
                centre is the area in which the turtles lay their eggs, as they have distinct little mounds of
                sand
                piled neatly between one another. Each of these mounds is monitored closely to calculate the
                hatching process of the turtle eggs.

                    is
                    especially shallow and the waves are very calm and flat. It is said that you can see sea
                    turtles at this
                    spot. And they do it on a daily basis, which attracts many tourists there. You can watch

                    the
                    lagoon from early morning until 3-4 pm.
                    <br><br>
                    Tourists have the opportunity not only to photograph huge turtles, but also to carefully
                    feed them,
                    sometimes even pet them. The key word in this case is "careful" - sea turtles have teeth
                    and they use
                    them.
                    The approach to the lagoon, photos with turtles and feeding turtles are FREE, </p>

                    <br><br>
                    Once the eggs hatch, the baby turtles are placed in a tank until they are ready to be released
