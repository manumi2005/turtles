                        <p>There are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They are found on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the ocean.
                            The largest green turtle nesting population is found at Tortuguero, on the coast of Costa Rica where about 22,500 green turtle females nest annually. Raine Island, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, has the second largest nesting population of about 18,000 females per season.
                        <br><br>Sea turtles have seven live species, which are classified into six genera by scientists. Every sea turtle has a scientific and a colloquial name. The scientific name specifies the genus and species, whereas the common name usually reflects a physical feature of the turtle.

                        Different sea turtle species prefer different types of food. Sea turtles have particularly designed mouths and jaws to help them eat the foods they prefer. And each sea turtle species eats, sleeps, mates, and swims in various places. Their habitats may overlap, but they each have distinct preferences.</p>
