                    <p>Turtle hatcheries are not sanctuaries, zoos, rescue or rehabilitation centres. They are used – or
                        should be used – only when natural nesting conditions are threatened, such as by flooding,
                        erosion,
                        predation or heavy poaching.
                        <br><br>Presently, there are five species of turtles that are taken care of in the hatchery and
                        rescue centre. Such species are the Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle,
                        Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle. The facilities of the sea turtle hatchery and rescue centre
                        are
                        all state-of-the-art, complete with water tanks to care for newborn turtles, along with adult
                        turtle
                        species that have been rescued from the sea due to injuries. One of the more peculiar sights in
                        the
                        centre is the area in which the turtles lay their eggs, as they have distinct little mounds of
                        sand
                        piled neatly between one another. Each of these mounds is monitored closely to calculate the
                        hatching process of the turtle eggs.
