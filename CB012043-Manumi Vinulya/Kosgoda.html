              <p>The Turtle Care Centre at Kosgoda Beach is one of 18 turtle hatcheries along Sri Lanka's southern coast. The center was founded in 1981 in the South Western beach hamlet of Kosgoda. It is also very popular since Kosgoda is home to all five kinds of turtles that visit Sri Lanka. This is not the case with many of the other hatcheries on the island, whose beaches only host a subset of the species.
                <br><br> Kosgoda is one of the few hatcheries in the country where all five species make their nests. The Olive Ridleys, Leatherbacks, Green Turtles, Loggerheads, and Hawksbills are among them.The center primarily serves as a hatchery, making significant efforts to boost the rate of hatching and survival of juvenile turtles in their early stages. However, the Care center also treats and releases sick or injured adults back into the water. They also run volunteer and awareness initiatives for both domestic and international visitors.

               <p>The Wild Life Protection Society of Sri Lanka runs a sea turtle conservation initiative in Kosgoda. It was founded in 1988 to save Sri Lanka's turtles from extinction. It has since released over 3.5 million young turtles into the sea. The hatchery compensates fishermen for eggs collected at night along the long sandy beach. The eggs are buried in the sand by the hatchery, and when they hatch 50 days later, the newborn turtles are released into the sea. The turtle hatchery also houses damaged or disabled turtles, including albino turtles that would perish in the sea.</p>
